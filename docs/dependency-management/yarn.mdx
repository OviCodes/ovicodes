# Yarn

[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (version 1.x) is considered by many the most reliable package manager in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Basic commands

```bash
npm i -g yarn                               # install Yarn globally
yarn init                                   # add yarn to a project
yarn                                        # install all packages from package.json and generaye yarn.lock file
yarn add <npm_package_name>                 # add a package to the project as a runtime dependency
yarn add <npm_package_name> --dev           # add a package to the project as a dev dependency
yarn upgrade <npm_package_name>[@<version>] # upgrade a package to the latest (or to a specific) version
yarn delete <npm_package_name>              # remove a package from the project
yarn <script_command_name>                  # run a command from the script section of package.json
```

## Commit the lock file

:::important
The generated `yarn.lock` file should always be commited to version control (just like the `package-lock.json` file if you would be using `npm` instead of `yarn`).

**Some people who do not understand package management (and/or Git) argue agains this - please don't be one of those people!**
