# Yarn

[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (version 1.x) is considered by many the most reliable package manager in the JavaScript ecosystem and has great support for monorepos.

## Basic commands

```bash
npm i -g yarn                               # install Yarn globally
yarn init                                   # add yarn to a project
yarn                                        # install all packages from package.json and generaye yarn.lock file
yarn add <npm_package_name>                 # add a package to the project as a runtime dependency
yarn add <npm_package_name> --dev           # add a package to the project as a dev dependency
yarn upgrade                                # upgrade all packages to the latest versions
yarn upgrade <npm_package_name>[@<version>] # upgrade a specific package to the latest (or to a specific) version
yarn remove <npm_package_name>              # remove a package from the project
yarn <script_command_name>                  # run a command from the script section of package.json
```

## Global packages

```bash
yarn global list                                   # list all globally installed packages
yarn global add <npm_package_name>                 # install a package globally
yarn global remove <npm_package_name>              # remove a globally installed package
yarn global upgrade <npm_package_name>[@<version>] # upgrade a globally installed package to the latest (or to a specific) version
```

:::note
For the vast majority of packages it is considered a **bad practice** to have global dependencies because they are implicit. It is much better to add all of your dependencies locally so that they are explicit and anyone else using your project gets the same set of dependencies.

## Commit the lock file

:::important
The generated `yarn.lock` file should always be commited to version control (just like the `package-lock.json` file should if you were using `npm` instead of `yarn`).
