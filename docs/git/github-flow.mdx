# GitHub-Flow

GitHub-Flow is a **lightweight**, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where **deployments are made regularly**.

## Create a feature branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

## Commit all changes and push feature branch

```bash
git status
git add -A
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push origin feature-branch
```

## Merge a feature branch back into the main branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main
```

:::note
This is usually not done locally, but by pushing the feature branch and then using _GitHub_ (`https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>/pulls`) to open a PR to the main branch, get the changes code reviewed and performing the merge there.
:::

## TIP 1: Update feature branch with the latest changes from main before pushing

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch
```

:::note

- `git push --force` overwrites a remote branch with your local branch
- `git push --force-with-lease` is a safer option that will not overwrite any work on the remote branch if more commits were added to the remote branch (by another team-member). It ensures you do not overwrite someone elses work by force pushing.

:::

## TIP2: Fix conflicts when updating a feature branch with the latest changes from main

```bash title="$ git rebase main" {2}
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
error: could not apply 742e1f3... Update README
Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
Recorded preimage for 'README.md'
Could not apply 742e1f3... Update README
```

```bash title="$ git status" {10,13}
interactive rebase in progress; onto ceebf61
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 742e1f3 Update README
No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch 'feature-branch' on 'ceebf61'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
  both modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```txt title="$ cat README.md (before fix)"
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Title text updated remotely
=======
# Title text updated locally
>>>>>>> 742e1f3
```

```txt title="$ cat README.md (after fix)"
# Title text updated remotely and locally
```

```bash
git add README.md
git rebase --continue
```

## TIP3: Delete the local and remote feature branch

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D feature-branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch
git branch -vv
```
