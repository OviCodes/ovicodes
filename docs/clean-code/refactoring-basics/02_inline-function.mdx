# Inline Function

## Description

- sometimes **short function bodies can be just as descriptive as their names** so instead of adding more clarity these functions just add needless indirection in the code
- other times, **a group of functions can be badly factored** and you must inline them all into one big function before you can extract them again properly

:::warning
If the function is _polymorphhic_ (it is a _class method_ and there are subclasses that _override_ it), _recursive_ or has _multiple return points_ you shouldn't use this refactoring to inline it!
:::

## Example

```js title="Before refactoring"
function getDeliveryRecord(customer) {
  const record = []

  createDeliveryRecord(record, customer)

  return record
}

function createDeliveryRecord(record, customer) {
  record.push(customer.name)
  record.push(customer.street)
  record.push(customer.zipCode)
}
```

```js title="Input"
customer: {
    name: 'Mr. Luigi',
    street: '532 Oakland St.',
    zipCode: 'NY 10028'
}
```

```json title="Output"
["Mr. Luigi", "532 Oakland St.", "NY 10028"]
```

## Refactoring

### Step 1

- Use your IDE's _"Search in all files"_ feature to find all callers of this function.

### Step 2

- Check that this function isn't polymorphic, recursive or has multiple return points.

### Step 3

- Replace each call with the function's body.

```diff
function getDeliveryRecord(customer) {
  const record = []

- createDeliveryRecord(record, customer)
+ record.push(customer.name)
+ record.push(customer.street)
+ record.push(customer.zipCode)

  return record
}

function createDeliveryRecord(record, customer) {
  record.push(customer.name)
  record.push(customer.street)
  record.push(customer.zipCode)
}
```

### Step 4

- Remove the function definition.

```diff
function getDeliveryRecord(customer) {
  const record = []

  record.push(customer.name)
  record.push(customer.street)
  record.push(customer.zipCode)

  return record
}

- function createDeliveryRecord(record, customer) {
-   record.push(customer.name)
-   record.push(customer.street)
-   record.push(customer.zipCode)
- }
```

## Result

```js title="Before refactoring"
function getDeliveryRecord(customer) {
  const record = []

  createDeliveryRecord(record, customer)

  return record
}

function createDeliveryRecord(record, customer) {
  record.push(customer.name)
  record.push(customer.street)
  record.push(customer.zipCode)
}
```

```js title="After refactoring"
function getDeliveryRecord(customer) {
  const record = []

  record.push(customer.name)
  record.push(customer.street)
  record.push(customer.zipCode)

  return record
}
```
